# An Evaluation Framework for Image Tampering Localization 

## Introduction

This is a MATLAB framework for the evaluation of image tampering localization algorithms. It contains a number of implemented algorithms, and basic utility functions for evaluating the implemented algorithms against any image dataset. While currently the framework only includes splicing localization algorithms, it could easily be extended with algorithms localizing other forms of tampering, such as copy-moving.
